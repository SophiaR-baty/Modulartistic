# Examples
This Page shows a few example .json files with the image it created. It will also have some notes to better understand the examples. The example json files can also be generated by Modulartistic. Simply execute the program with `-?` on the command line and the directory `demofiles` will be populated with the examples on this page. 

## State Examples
### State Example 1
With this json file Modulartistic will create an image that, 
- is 500x500 pixels big
- each pixel has hue of `x*y`, and constant saturation and values
- the result is a colorful image, the shape is similar to the graph of $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ or rather $x\cdot y=1$

### State Example 2
With this json file Modulartistic will create an image that, 
- is 500x500 pixels big
- Uses RGB instead of hsv
- The color values are all calculated with `x*x + y*y` but in green and blue the x values are shifted by 1
- the result is a mostly black and white image, its shape is a circle since the function used is the circle equation, it has a slight offset of green and purple color
